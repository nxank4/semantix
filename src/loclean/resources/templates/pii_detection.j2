Task: Detect and extract {{ strategies|join(", ") }} from the following text.

Input Text: "{{ item }}"

Instructions:
1. Identify all {{ strategies|join(" and ") }} in the text above.
2. For person names: Extract full names (first name + last name if available).
3. For addresses: Extract complete addresses including street, city, province/state if mentioned.
4. Return a JSON object with an "entities" array.
5. Each entity must have "type" (either "person" or "address") and "value" (the exact text found).

         "entities": [
           {"type": "person", "value": "John Smith"},
           {"type": "address", "value": "123 Main Street, New York, NY 10001"}
